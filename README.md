This project was written to practice Querydsl in Java. 
It is a simple project to capture basic details of students in a faculty.
I was taught by Odedele Tunji(I call him TeeJay), a guru in Java.
I can now use Querydsl to write Get Apis, Post and Put Apis.
It is easier though a bit more complex than the traditional java.
It is almost impossible to learn this concept without the help of a mentor.
